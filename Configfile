# Version of the Blaze library:
#   debug  : Debug version
#   release: Release version (default)
VERSION="release"

# Compiler selection
# This switch specifies the compiler that is used to compile the Blaze library. The default
# compiler is the GNU C++ compiler (g++). Other possible options are for instance the Intel
# C++ compiler (icpc), or the Clang compiler (clang).
CXX="g++"

# Compiler flags
# This setting specifies the compilation flags used to build the Blaze library. Depending
# on the selected compiler it is recommended to use at least the following selection of
# compilation flags:
#   g++/clang: -Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Woverloaded-virtual -ansi -O3 -DNDEBUG
#   icpc     : -Werror -Wshadow -w1 -ansi -O3 -DNDEBUG
# In addition to these general flags, it is possible to specify additional architecture
# specific flags. In order to achieve maximum performance, it is recommended to specify
# the available architecture specific instruction set (for instance, -mavx for the GNU
# C++ compiler to active the AVX instruction set). Also, in order to enable the OpenMP
# based shared-memory parallelization it is recommended to use the according OpenMP flag
# (-fopenmp for the GNU C++ compiler, -openmp for the Intel C++ compiler).
CXXFLAGS="-Werror -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Woverloaded-virtual -ansi -O3 -DNDEBUG"

# Library configuration
# This selection configures which libraries are created during the compilation process.
# Note that in case both the static and shared library are built the static library also
# consists of position-independent code. Note also that any change of this setting may
# require a clean up via 'make clean'.
#   static: Only create the static Blaze library (default)
#   shared: Only create the shared Blaze library
#   both  : Create both static and shared library
LIBRARY="static"

# Library settings (optional)
# In case the shared Blaze library is built, on some systems it can be necessary to
# specify additional library paths and add additional libraries. This can be done via
# this setting.
LIBRARY_DIRECTIVES=

# Specification of the cache size
# Via this setting it is possible to specify the size of the outermost cache level. It
# influences the choice of the evaluation strategy of mathematical expression to achieve
# the highest possible performance. The value must be given in Bytes. For instance, a
# 3 MiByte cache must be specified as "3145728". If no cache size is specified, a cache
# of 3 MiByte is assumed.
CACHE_SIZE=

# Configuration of the boost library
# The boost library (see www.boost.org) is precondition for the Blaze library, i.e., it
# is not possible to compile the library without boost. Blaze requires you to have at
# least the boost version 1.39.0 or higher installed on your system. In case the boost
# include directory is not set, it is assumed that the boost headers are installed in
# standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/boost'). Additionally, in case a shared
# Blaze library is built it is necessary to specify the boost library path and the name
# of the boost system and thread libraries (as for instance 'boost_thread-mt'). In case
# the library path is not specified, it is assumed that the libraries are installed in
# standard paths (for example '/usr/lib/' or '/usr/lib64/'). If the name of a library is
# not specified, it is assumed that the library has a default name ('libboost_system.*'
# and 'libboost_thread.*', respectively).
BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH=
BOOST_LIBRARY_PATH=
BOOST_SYSTEM_LIBRARY=
BOOST_THREAD_LIBRARY=

# Configuration of the BLAS library (optional)
# The Blaze library offers the possibilty to use a BLAS library for certain basic linear
# algebraic operations (such as for instance matrix-matrix multiplications). If the BLAS
# switch is set to 'yes', the library expects the according headers in order to compile
# properly. In case the BLAS include directory is not set, it is assumed that the header
# file is installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/'). Additionally, in
# case the name of the BLAS include file is not set, it is assumed that the BLAS include
# file is named 'cblas.h'. The BLAS_IS_PARALLEL switch specifies if the given BLAS library
# is itself parallelized or not. If set to 'yes' Blaze will not perform any additional
# parallelization attempt, if set to 'no' Blaze will attempt to parallelize the execution
# of BLAS kernels.
BLAS="no"

BLAS_INCLUDE_FILE=
BLAS_IS_PARALLEL="no"

# Configuration of the MPI library (optional)
# If set to 'yes' the MPI parallel execution of the Blaze library will be activated. If
# set to 'yes' and in case the MPI include directory is not explicitly specified it is
# assumed that the MPI headers are installed in standard paths.
#   yes: Activation of the MPI parallelization
#   no : Deactivation of the MPI parallelization (default)
