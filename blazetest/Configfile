# Configuration of the Boost library
# The BOOST switch should be set to 'yes' if Boost threads are used for the shared memory
# parallelization of Blaze operations. In that case the Boost library (see www.boost.org) is
# precondition for the Blaze test suite, i.e. it is not possible to compile and/or run the
# tests without Boost. It is recommended to use the newest Boost library available, but Blaze
# requires at minimum the Boost version 1.54.0. If Boost is activated, it is necessary to
# specify the Boost include path. If the include path is is not set it is assumed that the
# Boost headers are installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/boost').
# Additionally, it is necessary to specify the library path of the Boost libraries and the
# name of the Boost system and thread libraries (as for instance 'boost_thread-mt'). In case
# the library path is not explicitly specified, it is assumed that the libraries are installed
# in standard paths (for example '/usr/lib/' or '/usr/lib64/'). If the name of a library is
# not specified, it is assumed that the library has a default name ('libboost_system.*' and
# 'libboost_thread.*', respectively).

# Configuration of the BLAS library
# This BLAS switch should be set according to the settings of the Blaze library. In case
# Blaze is configured to use a BLAS library, this BLAS switch should also be set to 'yes'.
# If BLAS is activated, per default it is assumed that the BLAS include file is called
# 'cblas.h' and is installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/cblas.h').
# Both default settings can be changed by explicitly specifying the BLAS include path
# and the name of the BLAS include file. Additionally, the BLAS library path has to
# be specified (otherwise it is assumed that the library resides in standard paths)
# and the BLAS libraries have to be specified (for example  '-lf77blas -lcblas -latlas'
# for the ATLAS library). If Blaze is configured without a BLAS library, this switch
# should also be set to 'no'.

# Configuration of the LAPACK library
# Several matrix operations, such as the matrix inversion, LU and QR decomposition, eigenvalue
# computations and the SVD, are only available via a LAPACK library. In case no LAPACK library
# is available, the according functions cannot be used and therefore must not be included in
# any test. In case LAPACK is available this switch should be set to 'yes', which enables all
# LAPACK specific tests, except for the tests for the 'gesvdx()' functions. These have to be
# activated explicitly since not all LAPACK libraries provide the functions. Additionally, the
# LAPACK library path has to be specified (otherwise it is assumed that the library resides in
# standard paths) and the required LAPACK libraries have to be specified (as for instance
# '-llapack'). In case LAPACK is not available the switch should be set to 'no'.

# Library settings (optional)
