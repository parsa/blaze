# Configuration of the boost library
# The boost library (see www.boost.org) is precondition for the Blaze library and the
# Blaze benchmark suite, i.e., it is not possible to compile the library without boost.
# Blaze requires you to have at least the boost version 1.39.0 or higher installed on
# your system. In case the boost include directory is not set, it is assumed that the
# boost headers are installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/boost').
# Additionally, it is necessary to specify the library path of the boost libraries and
# the name of the boost thread library (as for instance 'boost_thread-mt'). In case the
# library path is not specified, it is assumed that the libraries are installed in
# standard paths (for example '/usr/lib/' or '/usr/lib64/'). If the name of a library
# is not specified, it is assumed that the library is called 'libboost_thread.*'.

# Configuration of the BLAS library
# This BLAS switch should be set according to the settings of the Blaze library. In case
# Blaze is configured to use a BLAS library, this BLAS switch should also be set to 'yes'.
# If BLAS is activated, per default it is assumed that the BLAS include file is called
# 'cblas.h' and is installed in standard paths (as for instance '/usr/include/cblas.h').
# Both default settings can be changed by explicitly specifying the BLAS include path
# and the name of the BLAS include file. Additionally, the BLAS library path has to
# be specified (otherwise it is assumed that the library resides in standard paths)
# and the BLAS libraries have to be specified (for example  '-lf77blas -lcblas -latlas'
# for the ATLAS library). If Blaze is configured without a BLAS library, this switch
# should also be set to 'no'.
